Furthermore, with a starting median salary of 74.3k, its mid-career median salary is now 91.7k, suggesting that the estimated growth in its increased income over time differs by only 17.4k\n\nThis is in contrast to other similar high starting median salary degrees like Computer Engineering, starting at 61.4k and growing to 105k at mid-career. \n\nAssuming that we're aiming to understand the best choice of undegraduate major we should go for in order to maximise our future career's income, the best option that one would go for would be the degree that offers a high starting median salary, while also having a significant increase in its median salary at mid-career level. Whereas an undergraduate major that offers a low starting median salary and low growth rate of its median salary at mid-career would probably be one that we would avoid due to its lower short and long-term financial returns.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"salary_growth_by_degrees = degree_pays[['undergraduate_major', 'percent_change_from_starting_to_mid_career_salary']].sort_values(by='percent_change_from_starting_to_mid_career_salary')","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-13T07:53:58.087328Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-13T07:53:58.087596Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-13T07:53:58.093293Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-13T07:53:58.087577Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-13T07:53:58.092636Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(12, 14))\nsns.barplot(x='percent_change_from_starting_to_mid_career_salary', y='undergraduate_major', data=salary_growth_by_degrees, palette='BuPu')\nplt.title(\"Salary Growth from Start to Mid-Career by Degrees\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Percentage Change in Median Salary\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Undergraduate Degree\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-13T07:53:58.094256Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-13T07:53:58.094564Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-13T07:53:58.804017Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-13T07:53:58.094536Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-13T07:53:58.803065Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 4.

Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we gathered that:\n\n* The **average starting salary** across the different degrees is **~44k**, and on average, graduate's salaries sees **growth rate of ~69% from starting to mid-career**. This indicates that while the growth rate or starting salaries might defer across the different degrees, their long-term growth generally remains positive. This makes sense realistically as our salaries tend to increase over time as our years of experience and skills increase too.\n* While we see that a degree in Physician Assistant has the highest starting pay of ~74k, a degree in Math and Philosophy sees the highest growth rate over time of ~103% across the different listed degrees in comparison to the former whose growth rate sees the lowest growth rate of ~23%. Interestingly, this reflects that a **high starting salary does not always correlate with high growth rate over time**.\n\n\nAs this analysis utilises aggregated data from a survey, limitations of the analysis includes self-reporting biases, and uneven sample sizes across the different degrees.\n\nFurther analysis that might be helpful for a more comprehensive insights for prospective students choosing their degrees would be to also perhaps incorporate data such as tuition costs, employment rates after graduation, and number of years required to complete the degree.
